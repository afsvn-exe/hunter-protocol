# 🗡️ THE SYSTEM: HUNTER PROTOCOL

> *"I alone level up."*

A training application that evolves alongside its creator — built from first principles in C, growing from terminal to GPU-accelerated interface across the 210-day Hunter Protocol curriculum.

## 🎯 What Is This?

The System is:
- **A gamified progress tracker** for the Hunter Protocol 2.0 curriculum
- **A portfolio piece** demonstrating progression from C beginner to GPU engineer
- **A living codebase** that teaches systems programming through its own evolution
- **A recursive learning tool** — built using the skills it tracks

## 📊 Evolution Phases

| Phase | Days | Interface | Key Skills |
|-------|------|-----------|------------|
| **Seed** | 7-30 | Terminal | C basics, file I/O |
| **Sprout** | 31-75 | ncurses TUI | Data structures, modular design |
| **Blade** | 76-150 | Daemon + CLI | Linux internals, networking |
| **Shadow Monarch** | 151-210+ | GPU Graphics | CUDA, rendering |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Phase 1 (Current)

```bash
cd src/phase1
make
./hunter
```

## 📜 The Philosophy

This project follows two anime-inspired principles:

**Solo Leveling:** Start weak, grind alone, become overwhelming. Every line of code is a step toward mastery.

**Blue Lock:** Cultivate ego. Your code should be so distinctively excellent that it could only have come from you.
